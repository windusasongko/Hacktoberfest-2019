Multilinks is a new kid on the OSS block, checkout the [About Multilinks](https://github.com/ChrisDinhNZ/MultilinksCore/blob/master/ABOUT_MULTILINKS.md) to learn more. We are taking part in Hacktoberfest for the first time and we're really excited.

It's going to be 4.5 weeks packed with coding, designing, documenting, testing, collaborating, but most importantly, learning and fun :relaxed:

### Stay in the know

It would appears October have snucked up on us so we haven't had the chance to have all the issues nicely described, set up and ready to go. However, new issues are added every day with varying difficulty levels for varying skillsets. Software is not just about coding, there's something for everybody so remember to click the 👁‍🗨 watch button and save the repo for later reference by clicking the ⭐️ star button at the top right corner of this repo!

## Ways to get involved

Multilinks is a new project, now is a perfect time to get involve and see it take shape, from an idea into something tangible.  Below is a list of repositories which are the core components of Multilinks. Each repository will have its own list of issues. For Hacktoberfest "ready" issues, they will be tagged with #Hacktoberfest plus additional tags indicating the issue type and complexity.

> **Note:** Not all issues are intended for Hacktoberfest as they may not be groomed or blocked in some ways. So please only consider ones tagged with #Hacktoberfest. If you would like to work on an issue, let us know in the comment section of the respective issue and we will assign it to you if not assigned already. This way your effort will not go to waste.
